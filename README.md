This repository contains the code and analysis for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about loan applicants. The dataset encompasses various attributes such as gender, marital status, education, income details, loan amount, credit history, and more.

Objective - The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the loan applicant dataset to gain valuable insights into the demographics, financial profiles, and other relevant factors affecting loan approval. By addressing a series of questions and performing data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.
